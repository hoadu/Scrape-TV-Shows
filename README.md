# Scrape-TV-Shows
This python script takes all the tv show data from Wikipedia, IMDB and TV.COM, and puts it into mongoDB for the list of TV shows specified in Excel File. In the Excel file, you have a list of TV shows from 1992 to 2017 with wikipedia links attached to it. From wikipedia page, we scrape all the data (including the cover image of TV show which we push to Amazon S3) and from that same page, we also get imdb id and tv.com page link. Through this, we scrape data from IMDB and TV.COM (both for tv show and for each and every episode). At the end, we dump all this data inside MongoDB.
